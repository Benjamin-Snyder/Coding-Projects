This is my second project using C++.
This project helped me gain a better understanding of reading and writing to files, objects, and header files.
I understand this is still a basic program but it is a step to helping me get more familiarized with other concepts of C++.



HOW IT WORKS:
When you create an account it will create a new files for you where all your passwords will be stored.
It also will add your username and password into the main data base of accounts ("usernames.txt").
This main database is what is being read to check if your account exists and if the password is correct.

When you add a password, it will add all the information provided into the unique file for the account.
This unique file is what is read when viewing passwords
