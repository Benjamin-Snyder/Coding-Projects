This was my first project using C++. 
This project really helped me get familiarized with the ASCII table, switch statements, and calling functions.
I understand that this is a very simple and elementary program but it was a great way for me to dip my toes in the water. 
In this program you can encrypt and decrypt messages. 
There are multiple encryption/ decryption methods.
You are prompted with a series of instructions to properly encrypt/ decrypt your message.
